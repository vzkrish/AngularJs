Angular is a client side MVC Application
Angular is a Single Page Application

Single Page Application(SPA)
  One Real HTML Page, whose content can be changed in Javascript without having to download a new page.

  Server Sends an application engine along with the HTML Page. 
  This Application Engine controls the entier application including processing, input, output,painting and loading of the HTML Pages. 
  
  Four Principles of the SPA:
    Chunking:
      Pages are constructed by loading chunks of HTML Fragements
    Controllers
      Javascript code that handles complex DOM
    Templating:
      Coding UI and DOM manipulates are replaced
    Rourting
      Selection of Views and Navigation that preserves page state, elements and data
